# Open and Inclusive

Goal 10. Reducing Inequalities

Opportunities that Expand Possibilities

Which countries are making fast progress toward increasing middle&nbsp;income&nbsp;wealth?

What's their recipe for success in reducing inequalities?

We'll be charting solutions that:

- Foster Equitable Access and Inclusion
- Enable Equal Chances for Upward Mobility
- Remove Barriers to Level the Playing Field

Let's see if we can pull this data into a timeline with continent and countries as lines:

Reduced Inequality:  
[Percentage of people living below median income [The Bottom 50%]](https://datacommons.org/tools/statvar#s=dc%2Fs%2FUnitedNationsUn&d=dc%2Fd%2FUnitedNationsUn_SdgIndicatorsDatabase&sv=sdg%2FSI_POV_50MI.INCOME_WEALTH_QUANTILE--B50)

Issue/Bug: In the GDC site, adding countries to the timeline on the page above overlaps them on the same line of the timeline. Lines look different when clicking just one country.
